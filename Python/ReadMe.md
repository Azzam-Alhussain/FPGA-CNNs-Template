# This folder contains file which help prepare input data and weights

Weights from pytorch model zoo are downloded and converted into FPGA format which is suitable to be read in HLS code. 

Then, python script converts these weights into .txt format which is easily read also into HLS code and run these files to generate input images and weights

Copy these weights and images into HLS code folder
